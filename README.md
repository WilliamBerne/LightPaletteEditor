# LightPaletteEditor

This editor is used in Unity3D, to control diffuse, emission, fog, and light, so that the artists can design scenes more easily. 

There are 9 palettes, each can be saved or loaded at any time. They are stored in a txt file, this also makes it easier to transfer data between co-workers. 

With the same 3D assets, the artist can edit different themes by just recoloring the scene in the game.
